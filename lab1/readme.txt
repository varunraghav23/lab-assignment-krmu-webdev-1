Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio project.
This is a simple one-page website that I built to learn and practice HTML while creating something useful for myself.
Tags Used

Here are the main HTML tags I practiced with:
Header:<header>     Main:<main>      Table:<table>     Form:<form>
       <h1>              <section>         <thead>          <label>
       <nav>             <h2>              <tr>             <input>
       <a>               <p>               <th>             <textarea>
       <ul>              <a>               <tbody>
       <li>              <img>             <td>
                         <ul>
                         <li>
                         <br>
                         






The purpose was simple:
Learn HTML.
Build a portfolio I can improve later.
Test my knowledge by putting everything into one project.
